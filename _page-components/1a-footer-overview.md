The footer is a "bottom navigation bar" to wrap up a page on your site. It gives your site's visitors another opportunity to find the page with the information they are looking for, or to send them to another page they may be interested in. The footer also contains certain links and information such as the privacy statement, copyright agency, and last updated date.
