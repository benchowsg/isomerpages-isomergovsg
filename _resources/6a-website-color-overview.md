#### **Website Colors**

Each Isomer website has two main colors, a primary color and a secondary color.

![Image showing where the primary and secondary colors show up](/images/resources/website_colors.PNG)

The **primary** color is displayed in the following elements:
* the notifications banner in the homepage
* the hero banner button in the homepage
* font colors for headers
* underlined and highlighted text colors

The **secondary** color is displayed in the following elements:
* the key highlights buttons in the homepage
* the page banner in the inner website pages (all except the homepage)

> Note: If you are picking a new primary or secondary color for your Isomer website, please ensure that the color fulfills the minimum color contrast ratio of 4.5 for accessibility. If you have any questions regarding this, please reach out to us via Slack or email us at <admin@isomer.gov.sg>
