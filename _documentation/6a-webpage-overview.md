#### **Webpage**
Isomer supports 2 types of layout for webpages, a simple page and a left nav page.

#### Simple page
![Simple page](/images/resources/simple-page.PNG)

#### Left nav page
![Left nav page](/images/resources/left-nav-page.PNG)

Isomer webpages are powered by markdown language. To format or add content to the webpages, you may refer to the [markdown example](/markdown-helper/){:target="_blank"}

The **key difference** between the layout is that one has **no left navigation bar** and the other one **has a left navigation bar**. 
Other than that, they are pretty much the same.
