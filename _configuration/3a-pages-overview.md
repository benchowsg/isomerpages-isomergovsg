Pages are the meat of your site. It is where you can talk about your agency and your work in detail, post media releases, and so on. The content of pages are written in Markdown which comes after the front matter.

Isomer pages generally come in 3 different formats: simple first level pages, second and third level pages (such as this page), and resource room posts. With Isomer V2, all 3 formats have been consolidated into a single layout, with Isomer automatically displaying and hiding the relevant components on your content page. Hence, there is no longer a need to specify the layout for these 3 formats as Isomer V2 has been configured to use this consolidated layout by default.
