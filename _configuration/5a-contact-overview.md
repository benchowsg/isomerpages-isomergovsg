The contact us page is an easy way for you to publicise your agency's addresses and points of contacts. Isomer provides a `contact_us` layout for this purpose. Note that contact us pages cannot be posts, nor will they have a second or third level navigation bar even if part of a second level collection. In other words, contact us pages should only be simple pages in the first level of your site's navigation.
