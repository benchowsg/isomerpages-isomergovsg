Many government sites include a section where posts, media releases, speeches, and the like are released from time to time. Isomer provides support for a special type of collection for such uses called the resource room.

The resource room supports multiple categories. You can utilise this feature to separate different types of posts, such as blog posts, annual reports, and media releases. We strongly encourage you to carefully assess the type of posts your agency releases beforehand in order to come up with the most appropriate categories, so as to avoid folder restructuring down the line which may prove to be time consuming.

Posts are automatically sorted by date, with the latest posts displayed first. In addition, there is a dropdown menu in the top right which allows the user to filter posts by year.

Resource room posts can also be used for file downloads, using the `file_url` option.
