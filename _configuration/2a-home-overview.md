The home page is the front door to your site - it is likely the first page a visitor sees at the start of his session on your site. Hence, it is important to leave a positive impression and present information in a logical yet visually appealing manner, in order to direct users to relevant pages and continue their session.

The home page is made up of several sections such as the hero banner, informational sections, and a media release section. The full list of section types available are covered in the following pages.
