The navigation bar is the main menu that guides your site's visitors to the information they are looking for. Hence, it is important for your site to be structured logically, so that users can reach the information as quickly and easily as possible.

Group similar pages under a common category using Isomer's second level navigation feature as far as possible. If sub-categories are appropriate, such as in the case of sub-topics, you can use Isomer's third level navigation feature.

In the process, avoid:

1. Creating too many top level items in the navigation bar.

   When too many items are added, the items may "overflow" to the right. Items that "overflow" may extend beyond the edge of narrow screens such as iPads, causing them to either become invisible or partially visible, drastically affecting the user experience on your site. Consider grouping similar pages and categories under new categories and sub-categories to reduce the number of top-level items. Furthermore, keep the title of top level items succinct (within 2 words). Less is more!

2. Creating too many external links in the navigation bar.

   While external links (which are links to another site, which may or may not be owned by your agency) has its purpose, overuse can create unnecessary clutter on the navigation bar. Consider if it is more appropriate to place them as hyperlinks within a page itself.
