### **Can my agency website switch over to Isomer Pages?**

Isomer Pages is meant for informational services - this means that it is suitable for most corporate websites (Hotels Licensing Board, GovTech corporate websites) and other microsites (e.g. mc.gov.sg and National Digital Identity).

Some websites have both informational and transactional features. Isomer Pages can cover the informational portion of such websites. The informational portion of the website can then contain hyperlinks to the transactional portion of your website.

Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.

### **What is a static site?**

Static sites are websites that are comprised only of static files: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other documents (e.g. PDF, Word). Static sites do not require web application servers or databases.

In contrast to static sites, dynamic sites are websites that require web application servers and/or databases. Websites powered by dynamic Content Management Systems (those with servers) WordPress, Sitefinity, or Sitecore, are NOT static sites.

When a user tries to load a web page from a dynamic site, the application server has to pull a bunch of data from the database and build the web page from templates, before serving it to the user. This is all done on-the-fly.

In contrast, when a user tries to load a web page from a static site, the static files are served to the user immediately. This can be done because the static files are pre-generated even before the user attempts to access the static site.
