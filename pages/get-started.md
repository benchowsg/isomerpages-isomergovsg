### Welcome to Isomer! 

Isomer is an end-to-end managed service by GovTech which allows you to focus exclusively on your site's content. GovTech creates and manages the design for all Isomer sites, provides the hosting, and ensures that your site remains accessible, secure, and fast. 
> All you have to do is to prepare the content, and Isomer "builds" a fully featured and fully compliant site.

This model works very well for sites which are informational in nature such as corporate sites.

Ready to get started or have any queries? 
Reach out to us by filling a simple form [here](https://form.gov.sg/5dc80f7c03b2790012428dc5). 

We'll do a quick evaluation to determine whether your site is suitable for Isomer (most sites are!) and reach out to your separately.
Due to the number of requests coming in, we may not be able to accomodate all of you. However, we'll try to get back to you within 2 weeks!

Once we've determined that your site is suitable to be hosted on Isomer, we'll create a skeletal site for you. You can then begin following our documentation and start editing!

On top of the documentation, we can also provide on-site training to your editors, system administrators, and other involved personnel.
