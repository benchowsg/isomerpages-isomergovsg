### **Isomer**

Isomer Pages is a lightweight solution for Singapore Government informational services that employs UX best practices.

The goal of Isomer Pages is three-fold:
* To improve the user experience across informational services by using components from the Singapore Government Design System
* To reduce the cost of creating and maintaining informational services
* To reduce the burden of compliance so that agencies can focus on creating informational content

### **So what exactly is Isomer Pages?**
Isomer Pages is a lightweight website building and hosting service that helps  government agency websites adhere to modern web development and user experience design practices.

Websites on Isomer Pages are static websites built using components from the Singapore Government Design System. More specifically, Isomer Pages uses the Jekyll static site generator and GitHub Pages hosting service.

### **Benefits of Isomer Pages**

##### **Improved security over dynamic sites.**

Static sites are only made up of static files. Consequently, there is nothing dynamic that can be exploited in static sites. Dynamic sites on the other hand have one or more web application servers and databases that increase the surface area for exploitation. 

##### **Improved performance over dynamic sites.**

Static site pages are pre-generated, while dynamic site pages are generated on-the-fly. And because static sites are generated beforehand, they can be served via a Content Delivery Network (CDN). This greatly improves user experience because of faster website loading times.

##### **Less downtime compared to dynamic sites.**

Static site pages can be pre-generated and hosted in multiple places, allowing for redundancy.
