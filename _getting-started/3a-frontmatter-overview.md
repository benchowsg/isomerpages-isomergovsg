As covered in [Your First Page](/getting-started/firstedit/firstpage/), the front matter is the stuff enclosed in 3 dashes at the top of the page. The front matter is used to configure the settings specific to that page, such as the title and permalink. Certain pages like the [home page](/configuration/home/overview/) and [contact us page](/configuration/contact/overview/) have more configuration options, such as the content in the [hero banner](/configuration/home/hero/) or the [phone numbers](/configuration/contact/overview/) displayed.

The way the front matter is structured is called [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML){_target="blank"}. You can think of it as a language used to specify data in a way that can be read and understoof by Isomer.
