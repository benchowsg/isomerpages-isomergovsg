Now that you've set up your GitHub account, let's get down to making changes!

First, head down to your site's GitHub repository. A repository is like a Google Drive folder where your site's content and data is stored. A typical Isomer repository will look something like this:

We'll use the FAQ page for you to make your first edit.

Make sure you're in the `staging` branch. If you aren't, click the dropdown menu and select `staging`.

Open the `pages` folder, and click on `faq.md`. Once in, click the edit button.

The content of Isomer sites are written in Markdown. For now, you can ignore the stuff at the top of the page, between the pair of triple dashes (`---`). Type something after the second set of triple dashes. The file should now look something like this:

```markdown

Hello, Isomer! This is my very first edit!
```

Scroll to the bottom of the page, and add a simple note of the changes you've made under 'Update faq.md'. You can also add more details in the subsequent large text box. Make sure the option 'Commit directly to the `staging` branch.' is selected, and click 'Commit changes'.

Wait for about 1 minute, then head to your site's staging site. On the staging site, head to the FAQ page. Congratulations! You have just made your very first edit to an Isomer site!
