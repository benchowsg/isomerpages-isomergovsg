Over the course of the past few pages, you've created a GitHub account, and have been editing your pages on GitHub. Now, we'll cover what GitHub is and more importantly, how to use it, in more detail.

Each Isomer site has a GitHub repository. A repository is like a dedicated GitHub folder for your site.

GitHub is an online code storage service that many programmers use. It is perfect for storing and collaborating edits to plain text files, such as Markdown, but it supports multimedia files such as Word documents and pictures too. For plain text files, it even tracks the full history of each line, so you can easily go back to find out the author even years after it was written! This makes it perfect for government websites where tracability is important, and also acts as a further line of defence against defacement attacks.

Additionally, we also have a "2 editor policy", where at least 1 other person must review and approve when the live production site is edited.

There are a few guidelines to follow to manage your repository:

* Always upload document such as pdf, doc, excel into the files folder
* Always upload images such as png, jpg, gif into the images folder
* Do not upload filename that contain spaces. Always replace the spaces with dash (-)
